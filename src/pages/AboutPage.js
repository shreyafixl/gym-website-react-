            <p>
              Founded in 2015 by fitness coach Arjun Rao, FitZone began as a single training
              studio with a simple belief: everyone deserves access to world-class fitness guidance,
              regardless of their starting point.
            </p>
            <p>
              What started as a 2,000 sq. ft. studio has grown into a 25,000 sq. ft. premium
              fitness center with 50+ certified trainers, 200+ pieces of equipment, and a
              thriving community of over 5,000 active members.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, FitZone is recognized as the city's most trusted fitness destination —
              not just for our facilities, but for the genuine care we put into every member's journey.
